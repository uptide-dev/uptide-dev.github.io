# Landing page

`index.html` is the whole site: one static page with inline CSS, a few lines of inline
JavaScript for the copy buttons, and self-hosted fonts. No build step and no external
requests.

```sh
npx serve site         # or any static file server; open http://localhost:3000
```

## Files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | The page. Design tokens are the same as the list/check HTML report ([`packages/cli/src/html/assets.ts`](https://github.com/uptide-dev/uptide/blob/main/packages/cli/src/html/assets.ts) in uptide-dev/uptide); light and dark follow the system. |
| `favicon.svg` | The logo mark, blue in light mode and light blue in dark mode. |
| `og.png` | Social preview, 1280×640. Used for `og:image` and `twitter:image`, and meant for the repository's social preview setting. |
| `og-image.html` | Source of `og.png`. Render it at 1280×640 with a headless browser and save a PNG screenshot. |
| `fonts/` | Space Grotesk, Instrument Sans and IBM Plex Mono, Latin subsets (from Fontsource 5.3.0), each under the SIL Open Font License 1.1; the license texts are next to them. |

## Deploying

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes this directory to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`
that changes `site/`, as it is: no build step. The canonical URL, `og:url`, `og:image` and
`twitter:image` are written `%SITE_URL%` in `index.html`, and the workflow replaces them with
its `SITE_URL` (now `https://uptide-dev.github.io/`) just before upload. To move the
page to a domain, change that one value.

## Where the numbers come from

Every number on the page is printed output, never edited:

- `list` on [supabase/supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) at commit
  `9d1661dec1548ec5bf3ffb4f551376a7650c213e`, run with uptide 0.4.0 from npm (`npx uptide@latest list`) on 2026-10-06 from the
  repository root (`npx uptide list`). Rows are trimmed. Latest versions and advisories come
  from the registry at run time, so a rerun prints different numbers: when you refresh the
  page, rerun and replace the block and the four tiles together, and update the footnote.
- `check` and `fix` on [`fixtures/repos/storefront`](https://github.com/uptide-dev/uptide/tree/main/fixtures/repos/storefront):
  the same blocks as the uptide README's "Before and after". If those numbers change, change
  them in both repositories.
- Timings in the hero note: `list` on the storefront fixture (about a second) and on the
  supabase commit above (20 seconds).
